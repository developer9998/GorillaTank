## How to use the mod
### Enter a modded lobby   
To use the mod, you need to be in a modded lobby, if it worked anywhere else I would be in monke jail right now.   
To go into a modded lobby, go to one of the gamemode selectors, go to the next page, and select one of the four modded lobbies.

### Go to Forest
Once you have selected a modded gamemode, go to the forest map and connect to a room.   
The tank should be located to the left of the target closest to stump.
