## How to use the mod
### Enter a modded lobby   
To use the mod, you need to be in a modded lobby, if it worked anywhere else I would be in monke jail right now.   
To go into a modded lobby, go to one of the gamemode selectors, go to the next page, and select one of the four modded lobbies.

### Go to Forest
Once you have selected a modded gamemode, go to the forest map and connect to a room.   
The tank should be located to the left of the target closest to stump.

### MonkeMapLoader support
If you want this to work, you will need the GorillaTankMapLoader.dll file that is packaged inside the file thats in the release.   
Enter a map that has GorillaTank support and the tank will be located there. Once you leave the map it will go back in forest.   
**You will still need to be in a modded lobby for this to work.**

### Adding MonkeMapLoader support
In your map, add a GameObject called "TankArea", this will be where your tank will be located in the map.

Tip: If you put a cube inside the TankArea object that has a scale of 1.95 x 1 x 2.85, it can be used as a reference.          
The blue arrow is the direction the tank will spawn in.

After this, remove the reference cube and export the map. The tank will now show up in your map.
